# Simple AI Chatbot with a Web Interface

### üåê Project Overview

This project showcases the creation of a simple yet fully functional web-based chatbot. It provides a complete end-to-end solution, from a Python backend to a responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend. The core of the chatbot is powered by a lightweight, open-source Large Language Model (LLM) from the Hugging Face ecosystem, demonstrating how powerful AI can be deployed on a local machine.

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Python Backend:** A powerful RESTful API built with **Flask** that serves the web application and handles all communication with the LLM.
- **Hugging Face Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the **Hugging Face `transformers`** library to load and run conversational models. The code is modular, allowing you to easily swap in different models to test their performance.
- **Dynamic Frontend:** A clean, single-page application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that allows users to chat with the model in real time. The frontend sends prompts to the backend and displays the model's responses.
- **Conversation History:** The backend maintains a simple in-memory conversation history to provide the model with context for more coherent and continuous dialogue.

### üöÄ Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **Conda** (recommended for environment management)

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    conda create -n chatbot_env python=3.10
    conda activate chatbot_env
    ```
3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```sh
    pip install Flask flask_cors transformers torch
    ```

#### üìÇ Project Structure

Your project should be organized as follows:

1. folder/app.py
2. folder/templates/index.html

- `app.py`: Contains the backend logic for the Flask server and LLM integration.
- `templates/index.html`: Holds the frontend code for the chatbot's user interface.

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated and you are in the root directory of your project.
2.  Run the Flask server from your terminal:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```
3.  Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address:
    ```
    [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)
    ```

You should now see the chatbot interface and be able to start a conversation!

### 2. LinkedIn Post

I just built my very own AI chatbot with a full web interface! üöÄ

I'm incredibly excited to share this project, which taught me so much about the end-to-end process of building a practical AI application.

Here‚Äôs a quick breakdown of the tech stack:

- **Backend:** I used **Python** and the **Flask** micro-framework to create a lightweight server that serves as the brain of the chatbot. This backend handles all the logic and model communication.
- **LLM Integration:** The real magic happens with the **Hugging Face `transformers` library**. I integrated a powerful, yet lightweight, open-source LLM like **`TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat`** to generate human-like responses.
- **Frontend:** I designed a simple, clean user interface using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that communicates with the backend via a REST API.

This project was a fantastic exercise in connecting backend server logic with a responsive frontend, and it really brought the power of open-source AI to life. It‚Äôs amazing what you can build on a local machine!
